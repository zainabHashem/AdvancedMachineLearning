Advanced Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on implementing machine learning models and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for two datasets: Bank Marketing and Calories_Burnt_Prediction. The Bank Marketing dataset is used with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Decision Tree (DT) models, while the Calories_Burnt_Prediction dataset is used with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

3) Models
   
.Artificial Neural Network (ANN) & 
Decision Tree (DT)

The ANN model is trained on the Bank Marketing dataset to predict customer response to marketing campaigns based on input features.

.Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The SVM model is trained on the Calories_Burnt_Prediction dataset to predict the calories burnt during physical activities.


4) Graphical User Interfaces

The project includes GUIs for both datasets and models to provide an interactive experience for users to input data and obtain predictions.

5)Setup

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

6)Usage

    Navigate to the respective directories for Bank Marketing and Calories_Burnt_Prediction GUIs.
    Input the required data in the GUI interface.
    Obtain predictions from the trained models for the corresponding datasets.
